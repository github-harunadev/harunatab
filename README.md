# Disclaimer
Do not clone repository in any method (EX: git clone, Download as ZIP, or ETC).
Instead, download the .unitypackage file from the latest release and import it to your Unity project. Since I've made a mistake that made .meta file excluded from uploading, directly importing the harunadev folder to Unity project simply will not work. I will update into a new version as soon as possible.
